Full-stack development is the process of creating applications that combine both frontend interfaces and backend services into a complete system.
In CSC 305, the frontend is built with Flutter/Dart, which supports cross-platform development for iOS, Android, and web from a single codebase, while tools like FlutterFlow make UI/UX prototyping faster.
The backend often uses Firebase, where services such as Firestore NoSQL databases store data in real time and Firebase Authentication secures user access, with cloud functions and analytics extending functionality.
Together, these layers operate within a client-server architecture, where frontend actions (such as submitting a form) send data via JSON over HTTP to backend services for validation and storage, showing how data flow connects user actions to backend logic.
Development in this course also emphasizes workflow practices, including GitHub for version control, Kanban boards for project management, Firebase Test Lab for testing, and documentation through GitHub Wikis and help resources.
A real-world example is a dog-care app where users stream video of their pets through the frontend while the backend manages storage, authentication, and analytics.
This demonstrates how full-stack development unites design, functionality, and teamwork to create scalable, professional-quality applications.
